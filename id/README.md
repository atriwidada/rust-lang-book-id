# `/id`

Welcome to the Indonesian translation of Rust book.

This translation style is derived from [French's one]:
https://github.com/Jimskapt/rust-book-fr

Here is the core of the translation work of this repository.

Basically, it's a (progressive) copy of the main content of the root `/`, but
translated.

This root remains as-it-is, stay in English, and will be updated further when
there are some updates on the English book.

The translated pages are in [`/id/src/`][] folder.

And translated code in [`/id/listings/`][] folder.

Please read [`/id/CONTRIBUTING.md`][].
